    <h2> Here’s our story</h2>
    <div class="list">
        <p>We started out at our home kitchen, whipping up finger-foods for our friends’ weddings and nieces’ birthdays.
            Everyone loved our food and our innovative combinations of flavors.</p>
        <p>
            So, what started out as a family operated business quickly grew into a fully-fledged small business that we
            operate out of our professional catering kitchen in Lisle. The team has also grown to 6 people; we can cater
            at events as large as 1,000 people.
